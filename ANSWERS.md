    You can utilize styled-component, which allows you to create CSS styles for your components.  This has the benefit of allowing you to create fully custom component stylings.  There is also Bootstrap, and it's React library Reactstrap, which give you access to a vast amount of pre-styled components that you can customize as needed.  This has the benefit of allowing you to save time building each component's styling from scratch.  And, more recently, the Tailwind library was created to solve the problem of opinionated stylings within Bootstrap, by creating a library of unopinionated styling.
